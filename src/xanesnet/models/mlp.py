    A class for constructing a customisable MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model.
    The model consists of a set of hidden layers. All the layers expect the final
    layer, are comprised of a linear layer, a dropout layer, and an activation function.
    The final (output) layer is a linear layer.

    The size of each hidden linear layer is determined by the initial dimension
    (hidden_size) and a reduction factor (shrink_rate) that reduces the layer
    dimension multiplicatively.
