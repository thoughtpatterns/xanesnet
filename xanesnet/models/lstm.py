    A class for constructing a customisable LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.
    The model consists of a bidirectional LSTM layer follow by a
    feedforward neural network with two dense layers.

    The defined LSTM is bidirectional, processing the input sequence in both
    forward and backward directions. The output size of the LSTM is
    2 x the number of features in the LSTM hidden state (hidden_size).
    The intermediate hidden size of the following FNN is user-specified
