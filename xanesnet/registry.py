"""
This module provides central registries and decorators for registering
models, descriptors, and schemes. 

Usage:
    @register_model("mlp")
    @register_scheme("mlp", scheme_name="nn")
    class MLP(Model):
        ...

    @register_descriptor("wacsf")
    class WACSF:
        ...

Once registered, the classes can be instantiated via corresponding
`create_*` factory functions using the registered name.
